Paper: An Unscented Kalman Filter Approach to the Estimation of 
Nonlinear Dynamical Systems Models

Goal: extract maximum likelihood sub-routine to apply on the Loterra model 

Problem: still do not know how the MLE linked to the UKF bit
Dual routine has so many moving parts. Specifically, having the problem with 
the dimension of error measurement covariance matrix
